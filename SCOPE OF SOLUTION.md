### SCOPE OF THE PROJECT 
1. Real-Time Orientation Monitoring

Tracks and displays Pitch, Roll, and Yaw in real-time using data from the MPU6050 sensor.

OLED display gives immediate visual feedback, and serial output supports debugging and validation.

2. Variety in Applications

Suitable for robotics, wearable health monitors, gesture-controlled systems, drone stabilization, VR/AR systems, and gaming controllers.

3. Foundational Learning for Inertial Navigation

Offers hands-on exposure to IMU-based sensing, sensor fusion basics, and angle estimation .


## FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS 
1. Cloud Connectivity

The orientation data  can be given to ThingSpeak, Blynk, or Firebase for remote monitoring or logging.


2. Mobile App Control

 We can use Blynk IoT app to view live orientation values from anywhere.

And alerts can be added for abnormal tilt detection or sudden movement.

3. Fall Detection & Alerts

Triggers notifications (email/SMS/LED/buzzer) if object falls, tilts beyond threshold, or stays in unusual positions for too long.

4. Sensor Fusion 

Improve accuracy by implementing sensor fusion (accelerometer + gyro) using complementary or Kalman filters.

5. GPS + IMU Integration

We can be combined with GPS to track object location + orientation, useful for drones or delivery bots.
